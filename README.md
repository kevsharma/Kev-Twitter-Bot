Using the tweepy API, this bot tweets which holiday today is. 
If there is none, it tweets: "Unfortunately, there are no holidays today."

Otherwise it tweets the holiday from an aggregated list of holidays (with recognized holidays from nations around the world).

Deployed on Heroku to run once daily.

This project served as my introduction to APIs and the python programming language.
Twitter bot name: Bot3Hangman (whatdayisit)
