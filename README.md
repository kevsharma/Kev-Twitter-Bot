A toy project using a twitter bot to learn APIs and Python. Used during USACS mentorship program
This bot will put out 1 tweet a day. That tweet will display whether special name/holiday/event on that day. For example: On October 31rst, the tweet will say "Happy Halloween". The tweets will give information akin to 'I'm feeling Special'. The API that I will be using is Tweepy and HolidayAPI.
